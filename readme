try to figure out the performance improvement
brought by NRV optimization

however from the result, there is nothing different

Do I miss anything?

from a blog, it says if there is no explicit copy constructor, the compiler can also generate an implicit copy constructor. And therefore it is the compiler rather than the existance of copy constructor that determines whether to implement NRV optimization
